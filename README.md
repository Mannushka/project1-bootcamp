# Shopping list app

This is a shopping list app which allows users

1. Add new items to the list
2. Edit an exsisting item on the list in case there is typo
3. Cross out the item that has been purchased
4. Delete an item from the list
5. Clear the entire list, i.e. delete all items, in one click

## Instructions:

1. Add item: type the name of your item into the input field and click "Add item" button.
2. Edit item: click the item you wish to edit and type in the new name.
3. Cross item out: tick the checkbox next to the item.
4. Delete item: click the trashbin icon next to the item.
5. Clear the entire list: click "Clear all" button.

All items are stored in the local storage, so when users refresh the page, they will still be able to see the items they added/eddited previously.
However, upon clicking "Clear all" button, all items get erased from local storage. After the button has been clicked, if the user refreshes the page, the list will be empty.
